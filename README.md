# Video_Creator_From_Images
Image to Video Generator: converts a folder of images (Imagen1, Imagen2, …) into a uniform MP4 video. The script asks for image duration and final resolution, rescales all images to the exact resolution (stretching if necessary) and generates a fully compatible H.264 MP4 file.
